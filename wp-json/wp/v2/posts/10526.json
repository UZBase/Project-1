The reasons behind it could be over plucking them in the past, age, illness or something else. Many are also struggling with unruly eyebrows that do not hold their shape well. Sometimes people who are tired of managing their eyebrows resort to microblading. However, you can fix all these eyebrow issues with a new trendy beauty treatment loved by Hollywood stars \u2013 brow lamination. The new treatment is available on Amazon.com for more information.<\/span><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" class=\"ugb-highlight\">Eyebrow lamination is a good alternative to microblading, but it is also perfect in combination with it. In the latter case, you should get the brow lamination treatment first and microbladed at least 2 days later. For unruly eyebrows that hold into different directions, the procedure will help shape them in the right direction, soften and smooth over the eyebrow hair, and also visually lift the eyebrow arch. You can also hide gaps and create the impression of thicker eyebrows or extend them sideways.<\/span><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 50%, #f78da7 50%)\" class=\"ugb-highlight\">Before and after eyebrow lamination with Lash Super Booster products<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"893\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C893&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10527\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C893&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C262&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C670&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?resize=800%2C698&amp;ssl=1 800w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/lucialashandbrow.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/IMG_5438-2-1.jpg?w=1284&amp;ssl=1 1284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 50%, #f78da7 50%)\" class=\"ugb-highlight\">Related artidles<\/span><\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lucialashandbrow.com\/what-is-brow-lamination-2\/\">What is Brow Lamination?LUCIA LASH\/BROW (lucialashandbrow.com)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lucialashandbrow.com\/brow-lamination-in-stamford-connecticut\/\">BROW LAMINATION IN STAMFORD CONNECTICUT &#8211; LUCIA LASH\/BROW (lucialashandbrow.com)<\/a><br><br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 50%, #f78da7 50%)\" class=\"ugb-highlight\">Pricing<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lucialashandbrow.com\/permanent-makeup-services\/\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lucialashandbrow.com\/brow-services\/\">Brow Services &#8211; LUCIA LASH\/BROW (lucialashandbrow.com)<\/a><\/a><br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 50%, #f78da7 50%)\" class=\"ugb-highlight\">Booking<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lucialashandbrow.com\/booking-store-policies\/\">Booking \/Store Policies \u2013 LUCIA LASH\/BROW (lucialashandbrow.com)<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many people are unable to grow their eyebrows into a lush shape as sported by supermodels and actresses.
